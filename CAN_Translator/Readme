The CAN translator takes a message from one CAN address and re-broadcasts it on another.

This was developed for use with a Haltech ECU in the 4th Generation Subaru Liberty. The standard Subaru 3.0 CAN stream has no provision for wheel/vehicle speed inputs. 
The Haltech CAN stream for G3 WRX has provisions for wheel speed inputs.
  
To utilise the Vehicle CAN functionality, this code takes the Liberty CAN wheels speeds and transmits them to the CAN address used by a G3 WRX. 

This device needs 12V Power, Ground, and to be on the Vehicle's CAN bus to function correctly.
